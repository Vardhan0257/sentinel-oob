# Sentinel-OOB v0.1 — Behavioral Guarantees

## What Sentinel-OOB Guarantees
- Detects loss of heartbeat from a known endpoint
- Evaluates silence using time-based rules, not request frequency
- Escalates exactly once per silence incident
- Sends alerts only when endpoint was last known locked or unattended
- Maintains all alerting state off-host

## What Sentinel-OOB Does NOT Guarantee
- Malware detection or prevention
- Alerting if the endpoint is unlocked / user-present
- Protection after kernel-level or persistent compromise
- Availability under network isolation

## Design Philosophy
Sentinel-OOB prioritizes alert delivery reliability over alert precision.
False positives are acceptable; false negatives are not.

## Failure Model
- If the agent stops sending heartbeats → silence is treated as compromise
- If the server stops receiving heartbeats → escalation occurs
- If alert delivery fails → failure is visible via webhook errors

## Scope Freeze
This document defines the complete behavioral contract for v0.1.
