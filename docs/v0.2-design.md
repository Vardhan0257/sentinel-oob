# Sentinel-OOB v0.2 — Context-Aware Escalation Design

## Goal
Improve alert significance by incorporating user presence and network risk,
without adding detection logic or increasing agent complexity.

## Design Principles
- Presence signals never suppress alerts
- Presence signals only increase escalation severity
- False positives acceptable; false negatives are not
- Agent remains dumb; server owns decisions

## Presence Signals (Heuristic)
- Session lock state
- User inactivity duration
- Uncertainty treated as absence

## Network Context Signals
- Public Wi-Fi detection (unrecognized SSID)
- Untrusted network classification increases severity
- Network isolation treated as silence

## Escalation Logic
- Silent + locked + public network → immediate high-priority alert
- Silent + locked + trusted network → standard alert
- Silent + unknown state → escalate conservatively

## Non-Goals
- No malware detection
- No behavioral profiling
- No machine learning
- No endpoint data storage
