# Sentinel-OOB v0.2 — Presence Signals

## Purpose
Presence signals are used only to increase escalation severity.
They never suppress alerts.

## Presence States
- PRESENT
- ABSENT
- UNKNOWN

UNKNOWN is treated as ABSENT.

## Signals Used (Heuristic)
1. Session lock state
2. User inactivity duration

## Interpretation Rules
- Locked session → ABSENT
- Unlocked but inactive → UNKNOWN
- Active interaction → PRESENT

## Design Constraints
- No biometrics
- No ML
- No confidence scores
- No suppression logic

## Failure Philosophy
False positives are acceptable.
False negatives are not.
