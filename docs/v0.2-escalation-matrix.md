# Sentinel-OOB v0.2 — Escalation Matrix

## Principle
Escalation is determined by silence combined with context.
Context only increases severity.

## Inputs
- Silence duration
- Presence state
- Network state

## Escalation Levels
- LEVEL 1: Standard alert
- LEVEL 2: High-priority alert
- LEVEL 3: Critical alert

## Decision Matrix

| Silence | Presence | Network   | Escalation |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Yes    | ABSENT   | UNTRUSTED | LEVEL 3    |
| Yes    | ABSENT   | TRUSTED   | LEVEL 2    |
| Yes    | UNKNOWN  | ANY       | LEVEL 2    |
| Yes    | PRESENT  | ANY       | LEVEL 1    |

## Notes
- Silence is mandatory for escalation
- Presence and network never suppress alerts
- Multiple alerts for same host are rate-limited
