# Sentinel-OOB v0.2 — Explicit Non-Goals

## What v0.2 Is NOT
- Not a malware detection engine
- Not an antivirus replacement
- Not a SIEM
- Not a behavioral analytics system

## What v0.2 Will NOT Do
- No content inspection
- No traffic analysis
- No keystroke or screen monitoring
- No user profiling
- No machine learning

## Architectural Boundaries
- Agent remains minimal and dumb
- Server owns all decision logic
- Silence remains the primary signal

## Rationale
Expanding detection surface increases complexity,
false negatives, and attacker leverage.

Sentinel-OOB prioritizes reliability of alert delivery
over breadth of detection.
