# Sentinel-OOB v0.2 — Context-Aware Escalation

## Goal
Increase alert significance without increasing agent complexity.

## Presence States
- PRESENT
- ABSENT
- UNKNOWN (treated as ABSENT)

## Network States
- TRUSTED
- UNTRUSTED
- UNKNOWN (treated as UNTRUSTED)

## Escalation Matrix

| Silence | Presence | Network   | Level |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Yes   | ABSENT   | UNTRUSTED | 3     |
| Yes   | ABSENT   | TRUSTED   | 2     |
| Yes   | UNKNOWN  | ANY       | 2     |
| Yes   | PRESENT  | ANY       | 1     |

## Rules
- Silence is mandatory
- Context only increases severity
- No suppression logic

## Non-Goals
- No ML
- No profiling
- No traffic inspection

## Inactivity Signal
- Agent reports inactive_seconds
- Server treats inactivity > X seconds as ABSENT even if unlocked
- Inactivity overrides lock state
