# Sentinel-OOB v0.2 — Network Context Signals

## Purpose
Network context is used to amplify risk during silence events.
It never suppresses alerts.

## Network States
- TRUSTED
- UNTRUSTED
- UNKNOWN

UNKNOWN is treated as UNTRUSTED.

## Signals Used
1. Connected Wi-Fi SSID
2. Interface type (wired / wireless)

## Interpretation Rules
- Known SSID (allowlist) → TRUSTED
- Unknown SSID → UNTRUSTED
- No network or blocked traffic → UNTRUSTED

## Escalation Impact
- Silent + UNTRUSTED → immediate high-priority alert
- Silent + TRUSTED → standard alert
- Silent + UNKNOWN → treat as UNTRUSTED

## Design Constraints
- No packet inspection
- No traffic monitoring
- No network fingerprinting
